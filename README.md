# Coin

This is a minimal Rust project demonstrating a basic blockchain-like structure for educational purposes. It includes a simple `Transaction` type and a `Blockchain` that stores transactions. Unit tests cover all functionality and code coverage is measured using `cargo tarpaulin`.

## Development

```bash
# Format and test
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo test

# Optional: run coverage
cargo tarpaulin --timeout 60
```
